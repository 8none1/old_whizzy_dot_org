Not persistent user data. :)

I meant persistent customization of the hardware and software setup
across the guest sessions as you can&#039;t expect guests to correctly setup
mouse sensitivity or layout and text size of FireFox for the older
members of the family and such.

Example: Customize the frozen Guest session (guest account) to your liking
https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/2

But that uses LightDM so it would be nice if computer owner could do the
same by default with Ubuntu&#039;s new GDM login.]]></description>

#1 That&#039;s not really what the guest session is for.  There shouldn&#039;t be any persistent data at all between guest sessions, which renders #2 unnecessary.  Once you log out of the guest session everything is gone.]]></description>

Thanks Will

May i put my suggestions to you first to see if you think it is worth me posting them on the mailing list as apart from i&#039;ve always found Mailing lists confusing i&#039;ve also found that trying to suggest anything to the Dev&#039;s just gets ignored so you are left wondering.

I&#039;ve always felt that the guest account have a few shortcomings so as Ubuntu are starting from scratch i think the following would be an improvement and set ubuntu apart from the others.

1) Add an option for customization to the guest account so you can have persistent changes to the applications and the desktop that survive reboots but once configured it is then set back to temporary for all other usage as before.

2) Add an option to the Guest account for AES encryption that uses a new temporary randomly generated key/password at every boot for each Guest session so any previous usage is kept private , There is then no concern of any of the Guests Bank details or passwords being recovered with standard undelete tools should a laptop be stolen for example.

Not sure if above makes any sense as i&#039;m not always very good at articulating myself which is another concern for a mailing list.

Thanks]]></description>

Best place to talk to everyone is the Desktop mailing list here:
