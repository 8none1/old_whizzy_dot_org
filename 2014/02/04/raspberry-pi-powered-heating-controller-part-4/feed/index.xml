Hi Les,

Yes!  I have integrated it with Alexa - and it was pretty easy actually.  I needed a proxy on my home network that was exposed to the Internet so that Alexa can make REST calls to the heating controller.

I&#039;m at the point now where I don&#039;t even have the heating on a timer anymore - I just command Alexa to switch it on and off as I need it.  The hot water is still on a timer though.

I&#039;ve also hooked it up to Apple Homekit so that I can switch the heating on when I&#039;m away from home.  This is useful when we&#039;re out for the day and can come home to a nice warm house.

I&#039;ve posted a bit about Alexa integrations on here.]]></description>

The outside temperature ones are easy.  I went up in to the loft and poked a waterproof sensor out of the bottom of the roof, where the guttering would be.  For the tank sensors; my tank has a solid foam jacket, so I used a pencil to &quot;drill&quot; a whole through it until I got to the tank itself, then I used a bit of thermal compound that you use to attach heatsinks to CPUs, squirted in in to the bottom of the hole and pushed a temp. sensor in to it.  It&#039;s a hack, but it works fine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Will,

How did you attach the temperature sensors to the sources? Just taped to the outside of the tank? What about outside?

Thanks
