					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

I downloaded the provided firmware here at the current date, but it wouldn&#039;t upgrade. I searched in the web, found several firmwares, I upgraded to 8.4.2 first, then 8.5.4, then 9.2.1, but whenever I would try to upgrade to the provided 9.4.2RS3 it would fail.
In the meanwhile I found this link: https://git.synchron.com.ua/sysadmin/synchron_voip/-/tree/master/tftp/Cisco_Firmwares
Which has 9.4.2-1 which worked as well. In the meanwhile I believe that this firmware 9.4.2RS3 here is for another phone model and someone just changed the name of the files, as all other firmwares worked fine on my 7941 phone.

Thank you for the tutorial, its super and was super helpful nonetheless.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/11/howto-very-low-power-usage-on-pro-mini-v2-arduino-clone/#comment-69&quot;&gt;Arduino power consumption and management &#124; Raspberries and other fruits&lt;/a&gt;.

Nice article man. Just in case anyone is reading this and did what I did first. My arduino came as the 5v version with the 5v tab soldered. I removed the power led and the regulator, used the rocket scream low power library only to find it dropped to 2.7mA ~ 2.8mA range. Do what this guy says, its way easier to un-solder the 3.3v/5v adjustment solder tab. If you don&#039;t, you lose about 2.7mA to the resistor network that was used by the regulator!

Thanks for saving me from banging my head against the wall for a couple more hours!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Worked like a champ for me.  Asterisk 16 running on FreeNAS (in a jail).  Got several Cisco IP 7941&#039;s from Goodwill for a few bucks.  Flashed firmware to the SIP firmware you mentioned (it is still the latest on this old model).  Carefully crafted the SEPMAC.cnf.xml file and spent several nights troubleshooting (and being very frustrated). I relied a lot on the Cisco web interface to carefully review the logs.  I think if any addition to your very well done post would be to walk people thru that cause it does give line numbers etc on the XML file parsing errors.  Anyways, thank you again for creating this.  A fun little technical project to keep me occupied in these troubling times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, I finally got this working with two client VPN tun devices and its balancing nicely with all the traffic...until one of the remote VPN servers goes down. Then it just grinds to a halt. 
I thought it would just pass all the packets to other one that was still up. But it wasn&#039;t. Nothing going out or coming in.
I realize its been years since you wrote this, but hoping you might have some idea what to look for.
Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can confirm Asterisk newest version (as of March 2020) andCisco 7941G with newest SIP Cisco FW (as of March 2020) only works via TCP. The problem is that the phone is NOT answering UDP &quot;ChallengeSent&quot; packets sent from Asterisk to Cisco Phone. See the FreePBX fail2ban log for details.

Solution is very easy:
Enable TCP in FreePBX at Settings =&#062; Asterisk SIP Settings =&#062; SIP Leacy Settings tab =&#062; Activate TCP =&#062; Yes

Change the config file from above from
 2
to
 1
for TCP.

Done the phone works instantly.]]></description>

Hi Les,

Yes!  I have integrated it with Alexa - and it was pretty easy actually.  I needed a proxy on my home network that was exposed to the Internet so that Alexa can make REST calls to the heating controller.

I&#039;m at the point now where I don&#039;t even have the heating on a timer anymore - I just command Alexa to switch it on and off as I need it.  The hot water is still on a timer though.

I&#039;ve also hooked it up to Apple Homekit so that I can switch the heating on when I&#039;m away from home.  This is useful when we&#039;re out for the day and can come home to a nice warm house.

I&#039;ve posted a bit about Alexa integrations on here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this comprehensive how-to. I&#039;ve got things working between the Cyber Attic and the kitchen after a couple of days wrestling with dhcpd, tftpd etc.

Current freePBX on raspberry pi uses port 5160 for CHAN_SIP and 5060 for CHAN_PJSP, which I spotted for the SEP[MAC].cnf.xml files. For a while I got error tones when trying to dial, but changing that port number in the FreePBX gui -&#062; Settings -&#062; Asterisk SIP settings seemed to help, or maybe it was the reboot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just purchased 25 x 7941 PLUS other Cisco stuff for 99p from eBay and made a local pick up - bargain?

The phones are/were set up for SCCP.

I managed to upgrade the firmware of one of the phones to SIP, SIP41.9-2-1S.

 The cnf.xml file appears to upload, : sent 14 blks, 7057 bytes in 0 s. 0 blk resent [13/06 22:42:10.980], from the TFTP server but the phone still displays &quot;Unprovisioned&quot;

The editor used was the Micosoft XML notepad that seems to be do the job.

This is my first attempt at this and my first impression was that it looked straight forward but this does not appear to be the case!!

Any tips and samples of working files would be most welcome.

Cheers - John

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. Usually, when setting up Account Linking we follow these 4 simple steps:

1. Set up Security Profile for Login with Amazon
2. Enable Account Linking in Amazon Developer Console
3. Add Redirect URLs to Security Profile
4. Make an API call to Amazon Profile API with BotTalk (no node.js needed)

We put out a nice tutorial summing it all up with lots of pictures =) https://docs.bottalk.de/tutorials/alexa-login-with-amazon-email]]></description>

What kernel is your device running?  It could still be caching the routes.  Also have a ip route show, and see what the default is.  If it&#039;s not shown check ip rule and then check those tables too.

Sorry, not got much of a clue at the moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Up for a challenge?
I set this up in OpenVPN client using Tun(s) instead of physical eth ports. I have tun0, tun1, tun2 for three simultaneous connections to three different VPN servers. And everything connects and works - except the weighted routing. 
My Pings out the different interfaces work:
ping -I tun0 8.8.8.8
ping -I tun1 8.8.8.8
ping -I tun2 8.8.8.8
And ifconfig shows packets sent and received over each of the tuns, but tun1 is always being used as the default even though I&#039;ve give tun0 a weight of 3, tun1 weight 2, and tun3 weight1.
I think this is because of either router caching or tun1 always connects first. 
But if I try to look at the router cache, it shows nothing (ip route show cache).
It will, on very rare occasions, switch to another tun, but it often switches to tun2 (with the lowest weight) even though tun0 is up, working, and has the heighest weight.
Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? Where I can look for clues?
Thanks! And great article! I&#039;m like 90% there with this!!]]></description>

It&#039;s since July that I try to register my Cisco 7961G on Asterisk, but I can not.
I&#039;ve read the post so many times, but I can not.
I have the sip firmware 9.4.2sr3.1s and asterisk 15.4.0 FreePBX 14.0.3.19.
I&#039;m using sepmac.cnf.xml of the copied from this post.

Who managed to run the cisco 7961g, can send me the configuration.
Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this!!

Finally got my Cisco 7941G working with my freePBX. 

I was wondering if it supports a login feature like example. 

User can go to any phone and login to their ext?

Thank you again!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, great post. Will the board run ok with power directly from the batteries, even when the voltage starts to drop? A pair of alkaline batteries will start at 3v and then drop over time, I guess. Do you think rechargeable batteries will work too? Two rechargeable AAs would start at 2,4 volts ...

And: Do you adjust the clock speed on these boards?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS!

Post up a LTC or BTC address so I can buy you a beer. You saved me hours.

Some things that tripped me up:

I needed to use CHAN_SIP, not PJSIP.

If you are making a Cisco 7961G work, if you don&#039;t include a dialplan.xml, all of your outgoing calls will fail, as the inter-digit delay will become 0 or something close to it; it tries to dial the first digit you hit. Incoming calls will work fine. Adding the dialplan.xml file (I used a basically empty one) will prevent this from happening. Not sure if tags will post, but below:

&lt;!-- Anything else --&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post, it helped me after countless hours of trying to get 7961G running.

Weird thing though, the phone registered to a VoIP provider only when I set the transport protocol to TCP. UDP just didn&#039;t work. I spoke with the provider and they told me I&#039;m rejecting the UDP packets coming back from them.

So I&#039;ve tried to forward ports, even putting the phone to DMZ, no luck. Maybe there are more settings related to using UDP?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, whenever I add a second sip line, the phone keeps restarting.

One key thing is that each sip account is different and they both use different ports 5063 and 5062 but the server is the same, matching the settings on the server for each line.  I did try and put them both on the same port, but that didn&#039;t work either.

Everything works if I just use one or the other.  Any ideas?]]></description>

WRN 15:03:16.255820 JVM: Startup Module Loader|JPlatUi:  &#8211; platformResetReq: resetRequest type=2</p>
<p>One key thing is that each sip account is different and they both use different ports 5063 and 5062 but the server is the same, matching the settings on the server for each line.  I did try and put them both on the same port, but that didn&#8217;t work either.</p>
<p>Everything works if I just use one or the other.  Any ideas?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello will, 
Thank you for great the guide. Following  I managed to get a 7961g working with freepbx.  I am in Toronto,Canada. I can make and receive local (10 digits) only remaining issue is that I can&#039;t make any international calls (I am able to make the same international calls from other extentions  connected to my freepbx) . I suspect that it&#039;s an issue with the dialplan.xml.  
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks .]]></description>
