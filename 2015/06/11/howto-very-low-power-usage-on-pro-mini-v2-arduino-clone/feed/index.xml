					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/11/howto-very-low-power-usage-on-pro-mini-v2-arduino-clone/#comment-69&quot;&gt;Arduino power consumption and management &#124; Raspberries and other fruits&lt;/a&gt;.

Nice article man. Just in case anyone is reading this and did what I did first. My arduino came as the 5v version with the 5v tab soldered. I removed the power led and the regulator, used the rocket scream low power library only to find it dropped to 2.7mA ~ 2.8mA range. Do what this guy says, its way easier to un-solder the 3.3v/5v adjustment solder tab. If you don&#039;t, you lose about 2.7mA to the resistor network that was used by the regulator!

Thanks for saving me from banging my head against the wall for a couple more hours!]]></description>

If you drop the clock speed down to 8Mhz these boards will run okish down to about 2v.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, great post. Will the board run ok with power directly from the batteries, even when the voltage starts to drop? A pair of alkaline batteries will start at 3v and then drop over time, I guess. Do you think rechargeable batteries will work too? Two rechargeable AAs would start at 2,4 volts ...

And: Do you adjust the clock speed on these boards?]]></description>

Waiting for update too! I assume you just waited for batteries to lose Their charge? :) Please update me when comming soon part will come and if it&#039;s close, meybe i can ask for partial data from your experiment?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found better way to stop the led to light.
As we know, led can&#039;t be powered directly from battery...because... are burned....
That&#039;s it!

Place very carefully the wires of a battery (3v) on led corners. Don&#039;t expect to see anything.
Power the arduino pro mini to check if you have done.
Led never lights again!!]]></description>
